title: Solve real problems for real people
---

This sounds like such a cliché. But we can’t help feeling like this keeps getting lost. We’re happy if you have a technology for us to use internally, something that'll make a City department’s work easier. But we’d be even happier if you were solving problems for residents. Talk to people on the street, talk to local businesses, talk to artists, talk to architects and planners, talk to advocacy groups—and talk to them before you call us. Show us that you’ve met them, thought about their interaction with the City, and designed around their needs and experiences.

When we day-dream about Ottawa’s use of sensors, we imagine a city in which residents could check sensors out of the Ottawa Public Library, and use them to answer their own questions. That way, they'd only be used by real people to answer real questions or solve real problems. That sounds far-fetched, but it's the kind of thing that we're aspiring to.
