title: Solve real problems for real people
---

This sounds like such a cliché. But we can’t help feeling like this keeps getting lost. We’re happy if you have a technology for us to use internally, something that'll make a City department’s work easier. But we’d be even happier if you were solving problems for residents. Talk to people on the street, talk to local businesses, talk to artists, talk to architects and planners, talk to advocacy groups—and talk to them before you call us. Show us that you’ve met them, thought about their interaction with the City, and designed around their needs and experiences.

When we day-dream about Boston’s use of sensors, we imagine a city in which residents could check sensors out of the Boston Public Library, and use them to answer their own questions. Or one in which a City agency could ask a question about a particular street, intersection, or vacant parcel, and have the answer presented to them based on sensor data. These may be far-fetched, but they’re what we aspire to.
