title: We need better decisions, not better data
---

Nigel Jacob, co-founder of the [Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics](http://newurbanmechanics.org/boston/), puts it well: when a new smart city technology is pitched, the costs that the City has to bear are immediate. The benefits, though, are way out in the future. They’re framed in terms like, “the money you’ll save when you can optimize the routes of Public Works employees” or “the money you’ll save from delivering a City service only to those who need it.”

The problem is that those benefits are nebulous and really hard to achieve. They require behavior change—and, sometimes, policy changes—on the part of some other person or department. And behavior change that is dynamic, based on the output and analysis of some data that they didn’t necessarily collect. We’re really far away from knowing how to affect that sort of behavior change within City government. And that’s why, so far, most smart city pilot projects have ended with Powerpoint presentations of data.

So try to move beyond "data," "algorithms," and the like. Let's talk about the stuff that makes those things useful and usable.
