# BOSTON SMART CITY PLAYBOOK

The age of the "Smart City" is upon us!

It's just that, we don't really know what that means. Or, at least, not yet.

So far, many "Smart City" pilot projects that we've undertaken here in Boston have ended with a glossy presentation, and a collective shrug. Nobody's really known what to do next, or how the technology and data might lead to new or improved services. 

We want to change that. We address this playbook to the technology companies, scientists, researchers, journalists, and activists that make up the "Smart City" community. In return for heeding this advice, we commit that we, the City of Boston, will not sit in City Hall and complain about the lack of solutions to our problems. We promise to get out into the City, find ways to help you pilot new ideas, and be honest with our feedback.

Our goal is to create a City-wide strategy for the use of sensor technologies that is people-centered, problem-driven, and responsible.

We need your help to get there.
